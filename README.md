## Introduction

The  NASA  Earth  Observatory  defines  Global  Warming  as  ”the  unusually  rapid  increase  in  Earth’s  average surface temperature over the past century” ([Riebeek](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming)).  As the global temperature has risen over the past decades,we are seeing more frequent occurrences of hurricanes and typhoons across the globe; these natural disasters have damaged properties, ruined communities, and destroyed people’s lives ([Miller](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2012/09/extreme-weather-global-climate-change-effects/)). **Is the increase in hurricanes and typhoons related to global warming? If so, how are they related?**

I will analyze global temperature data procured by Berkeley Earth across land and ocean, as well as hurricane and typhoon occurrence data collected by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration limited to the Atlantic basin and the Pacific Ocean regions.
