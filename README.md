## The Effect of Global Warming on Hurricane and Typhoon Occurrence

### Problem Description and Research Question

The  NASA  Earth  Observatory  defines  Global  Warming  as  ”the  unusually  rapid  increase  in  Earth’s  averagesurface temperature over the past century” ([Riebeek](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming)).  As the global temperature has risen over the past decades,we are seeing more frequent occurrences of hurricanes and typhoons across the globe; these natural disasters havedamaged properties, ruined communities, and destroyed people’s lives ([Miller](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2012/09/extreme-weather-global-climate-change-effects/)). **Is the increase in hurricanes andtyphoons related to global warming? If so, how are they related?**

I will analyze global temperature data procured by Berkeley Earth across land and ocean, as well as hurricaneand typhoon occurrence data collected by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration limited to theAtlantic basin and the North Pacific Ocean regions.
